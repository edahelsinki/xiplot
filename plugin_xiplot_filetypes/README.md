# [&chi;iplot](https://github.com/edahelsinki/xiplot) plugin for additional file types

This plugin adds support for additional file types (beside `csv` and `json`) to [&chi;iplot](https://github.com/edahelsinki/xiplot).
Currently, this plugin adds support for `feather` and `parquet`.
Note that in the [WASM version](https://edahelsinki.fi/xiplot) only `parquet` is added.
