# &chi;iplot

&chi;iplot, pronounced like "kaiplot"[^1], is a web-first visualisation platform for multidimensional data, implemented in the `xiplot` Python package.

[^1]: Pronouncing &chi;iplot like "xaiplot" is also recognised.

## Description

&chi;iplot is built on top of the [`dash`](https://github.com/plotly/dash) framework. The goal of the &chi;iplot is to explore new insights from the collected data and to make data exploring user-friendly and intuitive.

&chi;iplot can be run as a local server or as a [WASM-based browser version](https://edahelsinki.fi/xiplot). 

You can find more details in the [user guide](docs/user_guide/README.md) and [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12110).
