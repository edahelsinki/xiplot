# &chi;iplot

&chi;iplot, pronounced like "kaiplot"[^1], is a web-first visualisation platform for multidimensional data, implemented in the `xiplot` Python package.

[^1]: Pronouncing &chi;iplot like "xaiplot" is also recognised.

## Description

&chi;iplot is built on top of the [`dash`](https://github.com/plotly/dash) framework with its various extensions (see the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file). The goal of the &chi;iplot is to explore new insights from the collected data and to make data exploring user-friendly and intuitive.

&chi;iplot can be executed in server version or WASM-based browser version. 

## Dependencies

Install the depencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Execution

### Server version

Run `python3 -m xiplot` at the root directory.

### Serverless WASM version

You can try out the serverless WASM version of &chi;iplot at [www.edahelsinki.fi/xiplot](https://www.edahelsinki.fi/xiplot). Please refer to the [wasm](https://github.com/edahelsinki/xiplot/tree/wasm#readme) branch for more information on how the WASM version is implemented.
